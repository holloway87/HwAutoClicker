HWAutoClicker
=============

This is a simple mouse auto clicker, because I wanted to implement this feature myself using C++.

At the moment there is no configuration, the auto click is enabled and disabled via the Alt-A hotkey and produces clicks
every 100ms.

To close the program you have to kill the process with one of these signals: SIGINT, SIGKILL or SIGTERM.
